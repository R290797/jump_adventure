Hello, This is our Project



Ideas to Implement
- Varying Sizes of Platforms (Max Length Decreases over time - Always Random However)
- Varying Speeds of Platforms
- Double Jump (Needs to be Baseline)


- TODOs for Enemies:
Shooting to Kill
Kill the Player
Jump on Enemy to Kill


- To Dos --> 
Add Return types to Functions
Add Type Description to Function Parameters
Change Platform Screen Dimension to dynamic (not Hard Coded)
Make Player Move with Horizontal Platforms


Test to Write:
- Player Dies When off Screen (below the bottom)
- Player Can Move Left and Right
- Player Can Cross Over from One Side to the Other
- Player Collides With Platforms
- Player Can Jump
- Player Dies When Touching an Enemy
